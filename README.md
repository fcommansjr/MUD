# MUD
This is a basic implementation of the M.U.D. request form.
For this example, we'll use Node.js and Express as the server framework, and we'll use a simple in-memory data structure to store the M.U.D. requests. Keep in mind that in a real-world scenario, you'd likely want to use a proper database to store the data securely.
In this implementation, the server uses the Express framework to handle HTTP requests. When the client submits the M.U.D. request form, the server's /api/mud/request endpoint processes the request, generates a secure URL, stores the M.U.D. request in the mudRequests array (in-memory storage), and sends the secure URL back to the client.
Keep in mind that this example is still a simplified version, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to consider security measures, error handling, authentication, and use a proper database for storing M.U.D. requests securely. Additionally, you might want to add validation to ensure the submitted data is valid and meets your requirements before storing it.
To run this backend, you'll need to have Node.js installed. Create a new folder, place the above files in their respective locations, and run the following commands in the terminal:
npm init -y
npm install express
node app.js
This will start the server, and you can access the web application at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
